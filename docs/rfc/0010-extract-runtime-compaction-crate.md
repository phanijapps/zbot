# RFC-0010: Extract Runtime Compaction Crate

- **Status:** Draft
- **Author:** zbot maintainers
- **Approver:** TBD
- **Date opened:** 2026-06-29
- **Date closed:**
- **Related:** docs/specs/runtime-context-control/spec.md, docs/specs/rig-engine-migration/plan.md, docs/research/rig-engine-migration.md, docs/research/rig-comparison.md

## The ask

<!--
Answer-first. After this section a reviewer should know exactly what they are
being asked to approve, in plain language, without hunting through the design.

- **Recommendation (BLUF):** one or two sentences — what to approve.
- **Why now (SCQA):** Situation (agreed context) → Complication (what changed /
  the problem) → the Question it raises. Three or four lines.
- **Decisions requested:** numbered. Each = the question · the recommended
  option · a one-line why · decide-by (and the default if no objection).

Right-size to the stakes: a small, reversible change keeps this short and
collapses the sections below to one-liners.
-->

## Problem & goals

<!--
Diagnosis before any solution — name the problem first; if you can't, you have
a wishlist, not a proposal. Then:

- **Goals.**
- **Non-goals** — things that could reasonably have been goals but you are
  deliberately choosing not to pursue. Negated goals ("won't crash") don't
  count; this section is where scoping work shows.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
The design. Concrete enough that a reviewer can disagree with the substance,
not just the framing. Cascade the detail under each requested decision.
Include the migration path if there's existing state to convert.
-->

## Options considered

<!--
This section is mandatory and load-bearing.

- Enumerate the option/scenario space to be **collectively exhaustive (MECE)
  along a stated axis** — say what the axis is and why these options exhaust
  it. A small round count (e.g. exactly 3) with no exhaustiveness argument is
  a smell, not a finish line.
- **Ground each option in prior art** (how have others solved this shape of
  problem?) rather than inventing categories.
- Include the **do-nothing** option and its cost of delay. Sometimes it wins.
- State each option's trade-offs up front, against the goals — not retrofitted
  after the choice. A starred/recommended-option table is encouraged.
-->

## Risks & what would make this wrong

<!--
- **Pre-mortem:** assume this shipped and failed — list the top failure modes
  and their mitigations.
- **Key assumptions (falsifiable):** phrase each so a reviewer can point at one
  and say "that's wrong, because…".
- **Drawbacks:** what it costs, what you're giving up. "None" is not an
  answer — push back on yourself.
-->

## Evidence & prior art

<!--
- **Spike / de-risk result.** Identify the assumption that, if false, sinks the
  proposal; run a small/timeboxed check and report the result here — or state
  why no spike was needed. Do your own experimentation; don't hand the reviewer
  an untested guess.
- **Repo precedent.** Related ADRs, RFCs, specs the proposal touches.
- **External prior art.** What other projects/processes did with this shape of
  problem. Every citation must be fetched and confirmed to contain the claim it
  supports — a link that merely loads is not enough. Empty prior art is itself
  a finding (no one has tried this) — say so rather than leaving it blank, and
  never fabricate.
-->

## Experiment / validation

<!--
OPTIONAL — delete this section unless the proposal genuinely needs an
experiment. Frame the experiment here; do NOT paste raw results into the RFC
(that bloats the proposal into a lab notebook).

- **Hypothesis.**
- **What we measure.**
- **Success / failure criteria.**

Capture the results in a separate, linked spike note (or a follow-up RFC / a
superseding ADR), and mark the RFC `Experimental` while they're pending (see
docs/CONVENTIONS.md § RFC lifecycle); move it to a terminal status once they
land.
-->

## Open questions

<!--
Aim for ≤3. Each carries a **recommended default + owner + decide-by** — never
a bare question. Anything you could resolve by research must already be
answered in the body, not parked here; a bare question means the research
phase wasn't done.
-->

## Follow-on artifacts

<!--
Filled in when the RFC is accepted. The bridge from "we agreed" to "we did it".
