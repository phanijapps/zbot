//! The store-trait module: backend-agnostic KG persistence contract plus
//! its supporting types, moved from the retired `zbot-stores` facade.
//!
//! The trait lives here — next to the `types` it is expressed in — instead
//! of the facade, so the facade crate could be deleted without pulling the
//! `knowledge-graph` types into `zbot-stores-traits` (which stays
//! dependency-light for deep consumers like `agent-tools`).
