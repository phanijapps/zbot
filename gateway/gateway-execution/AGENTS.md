# gateway-execution

Agent execution engine. Converts runtime stream events to gateway events, manages agent delegation with callbacks, handles continuation turns, and emits lifecycle events.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo test -p gateway-execution    # 370 tests
```

For hot-path safety (runner.rs, delegation/spawn.rs), unit tests aren't enough on their own — run the Mode Full E2E after any change to `ExecutionRunner::spawn_execution_task`, `create_executor`, `invoke_continuation`, or the delegation spawn path:

```bash
cd e2e && ./scripts/boot-full-mode.sh simple-qa &
cd playwright && npx playwright test full-mode/simple-qa.full.spec.ts
```

Real zerod + mock-llm + real UI build + scripted browser. Zero-drift report confirms the LLM call shape hasn't changed.

## Dependencies

Depends on most other gateway sub-crates: `gateway-events`, `gateway-services`, `gateway-connectors`, `gateway-templates`, `gateway-hooks`, `gateway-bus`. Also depends on `agent-runtime`, `agent-tools`, and `zero-stores-sqlite` (replaces gateway-database).

## Conventions

### Context structs over positional arguments

Functions that take ≥7 arguments must take a named-field context struct instead of a positional arg list. Rationale:

- Same-type fields (e.g. four consecutive `&str` ids, or three `Option<Arc<…>>`) can be silently swapped on a positional call — the bug only shows up at runtime in the wrong DB row / event / session.
- Adding a new dependency to a positional signature touches every call site, in order. Adding a new field to a context struct is one line per call site, order-independent.
- `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` is a confession, not a solution. Don't use it; introduce a `FooContext` / `FooConfig` struct instead.

Established examples:
- Construction: `ExecutionRunner::with_config(ExecutionRunnerConfig { … })`
- Runner internals: `ExecutionRunner::spawn_execution_task(ExecutionTaskArgs { … })`, `ExecutionRunner::create_executor(CreateExecutorArgs { … })`, `spawn_with_notification(request, &SpawnNotificationDeps { … }, done_tx)`, `invoke_continuation(ContinuationArgs { … })`
- Lifecycle: `complete_execution(CompleteExecution { … })`, `crash_execution(CrashExecution { … })`, `stop_execution(StopExecution { … })`, `emit_delegation_completed(DelegationCompletedEvent { … })`
- Delegation: `spawn_execution_task(SpawnContext { … })`, `handle_execution_success(HandleExecutionSuccess { … })`, `handle_execution_failure(HandleExecutionFailure { … })`
- Batch writer: `BatchWrite::SessionMessage(SessionMessage { … })`

When extending any of these, add the new input as a named field to the relevant struct. Don't grow the positional signature.

### Invariant: zero `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` inside this crate

The workspace clippy gate runs with `-D warnings`. Any time you catch yourself reaching for `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` instead of adding a context struct, stop — the rule above was introduced to replace exactly that reflex. `runner.rs`, `lifecycle.rs`, and `delegation/spawn.rs` used to have nine such attributes combined; they now have zero, and a new one showing up here will fail CI.

### When to simplify vs. test

If a function has low coverage AND high cognitive complexity, simplify first (split, extract, introduce context structs) and add tests for the smaller resulting pieces. Don't test a god method as-is — you pin the wrong behaviour in place.

If a function has low coverage but IS small and single-purpose, just test it.

### Extract shared helpers over inline duplication

When two methods do the same thing with the same closure captures, the copy will eventually diverge in a way you can't see from either site. Prefer a module-private free function (or `pub(crate)` method) with a focused signature.

Established examples:
- `attach_mid_session_recall_hook(executor, memory_recall, agent_id, ward_id)` — replaced identical ~55-line `executor.set_recall_hook(...)` invocations in `create_executor` and `invoke_continuation`.
- `handle_tool_call_start` / `handle_tool_result` — extracted from the per-event match inside `spawn_execution_task`. The closure body used to be a 130-line switch; now it's a flat dispatcher. Both handlers take `&mut EventAccumulator` + `&EventHandlerDeps<'_>` so new events or new mutables don't grow the signature.
- `run_intent_analysis` + `emit_intent_fallback_complete` — replaced a 220-line nested-5-deep block inside `create_executor` with a single `Option<IntentOutcome>` return value. The caller is now one `if let Some(out) = ...` line.
- `prepend_continuation_recall` + `build_continuation_message` — extracted from `invoke_continuation`; both are async module-private helpers with clearly-documented preconditions for their no-op branches.

If the two sites have *similar* but not *identical* behaviour, resist the pressure to unify under an `Option`-flag argument — that often hides a behaviour change as a refactor. Check whether the divergence is intentional (e.g. the continuation task skips working-memory updates on purpose) before reaching for a shared helper.
