//! `BeliefContradictionStore` trait — persistence interface for the
//! Belief Network contradiction graph (Phase B-2).
//!
//! Contradictions are pair-wise rows between two beliefs. The trait
//! enforces canonical pair ordering (smaller-id first) at the
//! implementation layer so callers can pass IDs in any order. Backends
//! must reject duplicate `(belief_a_id, belief_b_id)` inserts silently
//! (idempotent) — the detector relies on this to skip already-evaluated
//! pairs without an explicit pre-check race.
